# OpenApps

> Discover, compare, and deploy selfhosted solutions

OpenApps was created to solve the challenge of finding and evaluating open
source software. While other directories exist, they often lack searchability,
detailed comparisons, and comprehensive project information. Our goal is to be
the definitive, community-driven source of truth for open source projects.

All project data is stored transparently in the `projects/` directory as
markdown files that anyone can view, edit, and improve. We aim to provide rich
information about each project's features, deployment requirements, and
real-world usage to help users make informed decisions.

What sets OpenApps apart:

- License badges that clearly show how each project's license impacts users (if
  the software is truly FOSS)
- Popularity scores based on commit activity, stars, forks and other metrics to
  surface active, well-maintained projects
- Detailed deployment information and complexity ratings
- Side-by-side feature comparisons across alternatives
- A opensource and single source for discovering, evaluating and deploying open
  source solutions

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

### Adding a New Project

1. **Create an MDX file** in the appropriate category folder:

   ```bash
   projects/[category]/[project-slug].mdx
   ```

2. **Use this template**:

   ```yaml
   ---
   slug: project-name
   name: Project Name
   description: |
     Brief description of what the project does and its main purpose.
   logo: https://example.com/logo.png
   category: analytics
   tags: [analytics, monitoring, privacy]
   github: owner/repository
   urls:
     website: https://example.com
   alternatives:
     selfHosted: [similar-project-1, similar-project-2]
     nonSelfHosted: [commercial-alternative-1, commercial-alternative-2]
   deployment:
     difficulty: "Easy"
     justification: "Simple Docker deployment with minimal configuration."
   pricingModel: Free
   hostingType: Self-Hosted

   # Project content in Markdown
   ```

3. **Add project content** describing features, use cases, and setup instructions

4. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   pnpm generate
   pnpm dev
   ```
