## Key Features

### Visual Workflow Builder

Create automation workflows using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Connect different services with visual connectors, add conditional logic, and build complex automation sequences without writing a single line of code.

### Extensive App Library

Pre-built integrations with over 200 popular applications including Gmail, Slack, Google Sheets, Salesforce, Discord, GitHub, and many more. New integrations are added regularly based on community requests.

### Custom Code Support

When pre-built integrations aren't enough, write custom JavaScript code within your workflows to handle unique requirements or complex data transformations.

### Trigger System

Start workflows automatically based on webhooks, schedules, email parsing, or events from connected applications. Support for both real-time triggers and scheduled execution.

### Data Transformation

Built-in tools for transforming data between different formats, filtering information, and manipulating data as it flows between applications in your workflows.

### Conditional Logic

Add if/then logic, loops, and branching to create sophisticated workflows that can handle different scenarios and make decisions based on data conditions.

### Error Handling

Robust error handling and retry mechanisms ensure your workflows are reliable. Configure custom error responses and notification when things go wrong.

### Team Collaboration

Multi-user support with role-based permissions allows teams to collaborate on workflow creation and management while maintaining security and access control.

### Workflow Templates

Start quickly with pre-built workflow templates for common automation scenarios. Templates cover everything from lead generation to customer support automation.

### Real-time Monitoring

Monitor workflow executions in real-time with detailed logs, execution history, and performance metrics. Debug issues quickly with comprehensive error reporting.

### API Integration

RESTful APIs enable programmatic control of workflows and integration with external systems. Build custom interfaces or integrate with existing business applications.

### Self-hosted Privacy

Keep sensitive business data and workflows on your own infrastructure. Full control over data privacy and security without relying on third-party cloud services.

### Scalable Architecture

Built on modern containerized architecture that scales horizontally to handle high-volume automation workloads and enterprise requirements.

Comprehensive webhook capabilities for both receiving triggers and sending data to external systems. Support for authentication and custom headers.

### Data Storage

Built-in data storage capabilities for maintaining state between workflow steps, caching data, and storing workflow-specific information.

### Queue Management

Background job processing with queue management ensures reliable execution of long-running workflows and high-volume automation scenarios.

### Import/Export

Export workflows as JSON for backup, version control, or sharing with other Activepieces instances. Import workflows to quickly replicate automation setups.

### Mobile Access
