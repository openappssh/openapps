# Unleash

Open-source feature management platform that provides feature flags, feature toggles, and A/B testing capabilities for modern development teams.

## Overview

Unleash is a comprehensive feature management platform that enables teams to safely deploy and test new features through feature flags and toggles. Trusted by thousands of companies worldwide, Unleash provides enterprise-grade feature management capabilities while maintaining the flexibility and transparency of open-source software. The platform supports multiple programming languages and environments, making it suitable for organizations of any size.

## Key Features

### Feature Flag Management

- **Simple Toggle Control**: Enable or disable features instantly without code deployments
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Progressively roll out features to increasing percentages of users
- **User Targeting**: Target specific users, user groups, or demographics
- **Environment Management**: Separate configurations for development, staging, and production
- **Feature Dependencies**: Manage complex feature relationships and dependencies
- **Scheduled Toggles**: Automatically enable or disable features at specific times

### Advanced Targeting & Segmentation

- **Custom Constraints**: Create complex targeting rules based on any user attribute
- **Activation Strategies**: Use predefined or custom strategies for feature activation
- **Flexible Operators**: Support for various comparison operators and conditions
- **Context-Aware**: Make decisions based on user context, location, or device
- **Dynamic Segments**: Create reusable user segments for consistent targeting
- **A/B Testing**: Built-in support for experiments and variant testing

### Developer Experience

- **Multiple SDKs**: Official SDKs for 15+ programming languages
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant feature flag updates without application restarts
- **Local Caching**: Resilient operation even when disconnected from the server
- **Metrics Integration**: Built-in metrics and custom event tracking
- **API-First Design**: Complete REST API for all platform functionality
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time synchronization for immediate updates

### Enterprise Features

- **Single Sign-On**: Integration with SAML, OAuth, and enterprise identity providers
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions and user management
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all feature flag changes
- **Project Management**: Organize feature flags across multiple projects
- **Environment Promotion**: Safely promote configurations between environments
- **Change Requests**: Approval workflows for sensitive feature changes

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with migration support
- **Frontend**: React with modern JavaScript
- **Authentication**: Flexible authentication with enterprise SSO support
- **API**: RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for instant updates
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with Kubernetes support
- **Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and health checks

## Use Cases

### Continuous Deployment

- Deploy code to production while keeping features disabled
- Reduce deployment risk by separating code deployments from feature releases
- Enable quick rollbacks without code changes
- Test features in production with limited user exposure
- Implement canary deployments and blue-green deployments

### Product Development

- Conduct A/B tests and multivariate experiments
- Gather user feedback on new features before full release
- Implement feature gating for premium or beta features
- Control feature access based on user plans or permissions
- Manage feature lifecycle from development to deprecation

### Operational Control

- Implement circuit breakers for system protection
- Control resource-intensive features during high load
- Manage regional feature availability
- Enable maintenance mode without code changes
- Quick response to production issues or security concerns

### Team Collaboration

- Non-technical stakeholders can manage feature rollouts
- Product managers can control feature availability
- DevOps teams can implement operational toggles
- Marketing teams can coordinate feature launches
- Support teams can troubleshoot with feature insights

## Self-Hosting Benefits

### Complete Control

- **Data Sovereignty**: Keep all feature flag data and configurations on-premises
- **Custom Integrations**: Build custom integrations with internal tools and systems
- **Network Security**: Deploy within existing security infrastructure and policies
- **Compliance**: Meet specific regulatory and compliance requirements
- **Performance**: Optimize for your specific infrastructure and usage patterns

### Cost Efficiency

- **No Usage Limits**: Unlimited feature flags, environments, and team members
- **Predictable Costs**: No per-seat or per-flag pricing models
- **Resource Optimization**: Scale infrastructure based on actual needs
- **Long-term Savings**: Significant cost reduction for growing teams
- **Budget Control**: Avoid vendor lock-in and price increases

### Customization & Flexibility

- **Custom Strategies**: Implement organization-specific activation strategies
- **Extended Functionality**: Add custom features and modifications
- **Integration Freedom**: Connect with any existing tools and workflows
- **Deployment Options**: Choose from various deployment methods and architectures
- **Data Retention**: Implement custom data retention and archival policies

## SDK Integration Examples

### JavaScript/Node.js

```javascript
const unleash = require("unleash-client")

unleash.initialize({
  url: "http://localhost:4242/api/",
  appName: "my-app",
  customHeaders: {
    Authorization: "your-token",
  },
})

if (unleash.isEnabled("new-feature")) {
  // Feature is enabled
  console.log("New feature is active!")
}
```

### Python

```python
from UnleashClient import UnleashClient

client = UnleashClient(
    url="http://localhost:4242/api/",
    app_name="my-python-app",
    custom_headers={'Authorization': 'your-token'}
)

if client.is_enabled("new-feature"):
    # Feature is enabled
    print("New feature is active!")
```
