# Dokku

Docker powered mini-Heroku. The smallest PaaS implementation you've ever seen.

## Overview

Dokku is a lightweight, self-hosted Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that brings Heroku-like deployment capabilities to your own infrastructure. Built on Docker, Dokku enables you to deploy applications using simple `git push` commands while handling all the complexity of containerization, routing, SSL certificates, and scaling behind the scenes. It's designed to be simple to install, easy to use, and powerful enough for production workloads.

## Key Features

### Simple Git-Based Deployment

- **Git Push Deploy**: Deploy applications with a simple `git push dokku main`
- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically detects application type and configures deployment
- **Zero-Config Deployment**: Many applications deploy without any configuration files
- **Branch Support**: Deploy different branches to different environments
- **Rollback Support**: Easy rollback to previous deployments
- **Deploy Hooks**: Custom scripts that run during deployment process

### Application Management

- **Multiple Applications**: Host multiple applications on a single server
- **Process Scaling**: Scale application processes up or down
- **Environment Variables**: Secure environment variable management
- **Custom Domains**: Easy custom domain configuration with SSL
- **Health Checks**: Built-in application health monitoring
- **Log Management**: Centralized logging for all applications

### Buildpack Support

- **Heroku Buildpacks**: Full compatibility with Heroku buildpacks
- **Multi-Language**: Support for Node.js, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, Go, and more
- **Dockerfile Support**: Deploy applications using Dockerfiles
- **Custom Buildpacks**: Create and use custom buildpacks for specific needs
- **Cloud Native Buildpacks**: Support for Cloud Native Buildpack specification
- **Lambda Builder**: Experimental support for serverless deployments

### Infrastructure & Scaling
