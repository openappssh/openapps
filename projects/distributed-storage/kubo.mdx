Kubo is the flagship implementation of IPFS, creating a distributed web where files are addressed by their content rather than location. It enables a new paradigm for building decentralized applications and sharing content across a global peer-to-peer network.

## Key Features

- **Content-Addressed Storage**:

  - Files identified by cryptographic hash
  - Immutable content addressing
  - Automatic deduplication
  - Verifiable content integrity
  - Version control built-in
  - Merkle DAG structure

- **Peer-to-Peer Network**:

  - Distributed hash table (DHT)
  - No central servers
  - Peer discovery mechanisms
  - NAT traversal support
  - Relay networks
  - Global content routing

- **Developer Tools**:

  - HTTP gateway interface
  - RPC API access
  - Command-line tools
  - Web-based UI
  - JavaScript libraries
  - Multiple language bindings

- **Decentralized Web**:
  - IPNS naming system
  - DNSLink integration
  - Decentralized websites
  - Censorship resistance
  - Offline-first architecture
  - Web3 foundation
