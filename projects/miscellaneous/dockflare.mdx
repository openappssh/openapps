DockFlare simplifies Cloudflare Tunnel and Zero Trust Access policy management
by using Docker labels for automated configuration, while also providing a
powerful web UI for manual service definitions and policy overrides. It enables
secure, hassle-free public access to both Dockerized and non-Dockerized
applications with minimal direct interaction with Cloudflare. Acting as a
dynamic, self-hosted ingress controller, DockFlare offers persistent, UI-driven
control over access policies centralizing and streamlining your access
management.

## Key Features

- **Unified Cloudflare Tunnel Management**: Automates Tunnel creation/use & cloudflared agent lifecycle (optional internal deployment or external).
- **Dynamic Ingress via Docker Labels**: Auto-configures Tunnel ingress & DNS from Docker labels (e.g., `cloudflare.tunnel.hostname`, `service`) by monitoring container events.
- **Manual Ingress Rule Management**: Add & manage public hostnames for non-Docker services (e.g., router, NAS) via Web UI; DockFlare handles Tunnel rules & DNS.
- **Versatile Access Policy Control (Docker & Manual)**: Define Cloudflare Access Policies (e.g., bypass, authenticate, custom JSON) via Docker labels; auto-manages Access Applications.
- **Web UI to manage/override policies for any rule**: UI changes persist, override labels, with revert option & clear indicators.
- **Multi-Hostname & Multi-Zone**: Supports multiple hostnames (unique targets, zones, policies) per Docker container (indexed labels) or manual rule.
- **State Persistence & Graceful Deletion**: Configurable grace period for Docker rule cleanup; persists all managed rules, Access App IDs, & UI overrides in state.json.
- **Intelligent Reconciliation**: Continuously syncs Docker, manual entries, & saved state (respecting UI overrides) with Cloudflare (Tunnel, DNS, Access Apps); shows UI progress.
- **Comprehensive Web UI (DaisyUI)**:
  - Dashboard: Tunnel/agent status & controls.
  - Unified Rule List: View/manage all rules (Docker & manual) with status, target, Access Policy (Cloudflare links, UI override badges), & delete options.
  - Easy Manual Entry: Add non-Docker services via UI.
  - Account Tools: View account tunnels/DNS.
  - Real-time Logs & Themes: SSE activity logs & multiple UI themes.
- **Secure & Robust**: Content Security Policy (CSP), API retries, and error reporting.

## Getting Started

### Important Prerequisites for Cloudflare API

Before you begin, ensure you have the necessary Cloudflare API credentials and permissions.

### Quick Start (Docker Compose)

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  dockflare:
    image: alplat/dockflare:stable # Or :unstable for the latest features
    container_name: dockflare
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - STATE_FILE_PATH=/app/data/state.json
      - TZ=Europe/Zurich # Set your timezone
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - dockflare_data:/app/data
    networks:
      - cloudflare-net
    # Optional labels to expose DockFlare itself via DockFlare
    # labels:
    #   - cloudflare.tunnel.enable=true
    #   - cloudflare.tunnel.hostname=dockflare.yourdomain.tld
    #   - cloudflare.tunnel.service=http://dockflare:5000
    #   - cloudflare.tunnel.access.policy=authenticate # Example: require login
volumes:
  dockflare_data:
networks:
  cloudflare-net:
    name: cloudflare-net
```

2. Create a `.env` file by copying `env.example` and filling in your details.

3. Run DockFlare:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. Access the Web UI: Open `http://your-server-ip:5000` in your browser.

## How It Works & Labeling Containers

DockFlare listens for Docker container events.

- **Label-First for Initial Setup**: By labeling your containers, DockFlare initially configures Cloudflare Tunnel ingress rules, DNS records, and associated Cloudflare Zero Trust Access Applications.
- **UI for Dynamic Overrides**: The Web UI allows you to dynamically change Access Policies for individual services. These UI changes take precedence over container labels and are persistent.
- **Revert Option**: You can always revert a UI-managed Access Policy back to be controlled by the container's labels via the Web UI.
