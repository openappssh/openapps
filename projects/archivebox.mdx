ArchiveBox is a powerful, self-hosted web archiving solution that creates permanent backups of websites and web content. It's designed to preserve important web content before it disappears, providing your own personal Wayback Machine that you control completely.

With ArchiveBox, you can:

- Archive web pages in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, screenshots, WARC)
- Import URLs from bookmarks, browsing history, RSS feeds, and more
- Create searchable archives of your favorite websites
- Preserve content before it gets deleted or changes
- Access archived content offline
- Share archives with others through a web interface
- Schedule automatic archiving of RSS feeds and sitemaps

## Key Features

### Multiple Archive Formats

ArchiveBox saves websites in multiple formats to ensure long-term accessibility. It creates HTML snapshots, PDF files, screenshots, WARC files, and extracts text content, giving you comprehensive preservation options.

### Universal Import Support

Import URLs from virtually any source including browser bookmarks, browsing history, RSS/Atom feeds, plain text files, CSV files, and popular bookmark services like Pinboard and Pocket.

### Automated Archiving

Set up automated archiving workflows that continuously monitor RSS feeds, sitemaps, or other sources for new content. Keep your archives up-to-date without manual intervention.

### Web-Based Interface

Access and browse your archives through a clean, responsive web interface. Search through archived content, view snapshots, and manage your collection from any device.

### Full-Text Search

ArchiveBox extracts and indexes text content from archived pages, making it easy to search through your entire archive collection to find specific information or topics.

### Offline Access

Once archived, content is available offline and doesn't depend on the original websites being accessible. Your archives remain available even if the original content disappears.

### Duplicate Detection

Intelligent duplicate detection prevents storing multiple copies of the same content, saving storage space while ensuring you don't miss unique versions of pages.

### Archive Management

Organize your archives with tags, collections, and folders. Delete unwanted archives, update existing ones, and manage your collection efficiently.

### Extensible Architecture

Plugin-based architecture allows for custom extractors and archive formats. Extend ArchiveBox's capabilities to handle specialized content types or integration needs.

### Data Export

Export your archives in standard formats for backup or migration purposes. Your data isn't locked into ArchiveBox's format - you maintain ownership and portability.

### Privacy and Security

Run ArchiveBox on your own infrastructure to maintain complete privacy and control over your archived content. No data is sent to third-party services.

### Headless Browser Integration

Uses real browsers (Chrome/Chromium) to capture dynamic content, JavaScript-rendered pages, and modern web applications that wouldn't be properly archived by simple HTTP requests.

### Command Line Interface

Powerful CLI tools for power users who want to automate archiving, perform bulk operations, or integrate ArchiveBox into larger workflows and scripts.

### API Access

REST API enables programmatic access to ArchiveBox functionality, allowing you to build custom integrations or automate archiving from your own applications.

### Scalable Storage

Efficient storage system that handles everything from small personal collections to large institutional archives with millions of pages.

### Quality Control

Built-in validation and health checking ensure archive quality. ArchiveBox verifies that archives are complete and accessible, alerting you to any issues.

ArchiveBox serves as your personal digital preservation system, ensuring that important web content remains accessible long after it might disappear from the internet. Whether you're a researcher preserving sources, a journalist backing up evidence, or simply someone who wants to keep important web content safe, ArchiveBox provides the tools to build and maintain your own comprehensive web archive.
