- Multi-dimensional data model with labels
- Built-in data federation capabilities

### Metrics Collection

- Pull-based metric collection model
- Service discovery for dynamic environments
- Support for custom exporters and integrations
- Push gateway for short-lived jobs
- Client libraries for multiple programming languages
- Automatic target health monitoring

### Query Language (PromQL)

- Powerful functional query language
- Time series selection and aggregation
- Mathematical operations and functions
- Rate calculations and trend analysis
- Histogram and summary support
- Vector matching and grouping

### Service Discovery

- Native Kubernetes integration
- AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud provider support
- Consul, Eureka, and DNS discovery
- File-based static configuration
- Custom service discovery mechanisms
- Dynamic target reconfiguration

### Alerting Integration

- Alert rule definition and evaluation
- Integration with Alertmanager
- Flexible alert routing and grouping
- Silence and inhibition capabilities
- Webhook and notification integrations
- Alert history and tracking

### Ecosystem & Integrations

- Extensive exporter ecosystem (Node, MySQL, Redis, etc.)
- Grafana integration for visualization
- Remote storage adapters
- Federation for multi-cluster setups
- Third-party tool integrations
- Active community and development

Prometheus is designed for reliability and operates well in distributed environments, making it an excellent choice for monitoring cloud-native applications, microservices, and traditional infrastructure.
