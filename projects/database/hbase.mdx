Apache HBase is a distributed, scalable, big data store designed to handle massive tables with billions of rows and millions of columns. It's built on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and provides real-time read/write access to your data.

## Key Features

- **Distributed Architecture**:

  - Linear and modular scalability
  - Automatic sharding of tables
  - Consistent reads and writes
  - Region servers for data hosting
  - ZooKeeper quorum for coordination

- **Data Model**:

  - Column-oriented storage
  - Schema-flexible tables
  - Versioned data cells
  - Sparse data handling
  - Row-level atomicity

- **Performance**:
  - In-memory operation
  - Block cache for hot data
  - Bloom filters for queries
  - Compaction for storage optimization
  - Write-ahead logging
