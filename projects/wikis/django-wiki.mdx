Django Wiki is a mature and feature-rich wiki system built specifically for
Django applications. It provides complex functionality while maintaining simple
integration capabilities and an excellent user interface, all built on Django's
powerful model system.

## Key Features

- **Django-Native Architecture**: Built from the ground up for Django, making it
  a natural choice for Django-based projects. Uses Django models for data
  storage and integrates seamlessly with Django's authentication and permission
  systems.

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Implements a tree structure for wiki pages using
  django-mptt, allowing for efficient organization of content with unlimited
  nesting levels and fast database operations.

- **Plugin System**: Features a robust plugin architecture that allows the wiki
  to grow in a structured way. Plugins can extend functionality without
  modifying the core system.

- **Markdown-Based**: Uses Markdown for content formatting, providing a simple
  yet powerful way to create and edit content while maintaining readability.

- **Revision Control**: Built-in revision system tracks all changes, allowing
  for content history viewing and rollbacks. Designed for scalability without
  relying on third-party revision control.
