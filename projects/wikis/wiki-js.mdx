Wiki.js is a modern, powerful wiki platform designed for teams and organizations
that need a comprehensive knowledge management solution. Built on Node.js, it
combines the simplicity of traditional wikis with contemporary features and a
beautiful, intuitive interface.

## Key Features

- **Modern Editing Experience**: Wiki.js provides multiple editing modes including
  a rich WYSIWYG editor, Markdown support, and a code editor for technical
  documentation. The platform offers real-time collaborative editing, making it

  integration for content storage. This provides version control, backup
  capabilities, and the ability to sync content across multiple instances. Your

  including LDAP, Active Directory, OAuth, and social logins makes it easy to
  integrate with existing organizational systems and user management workflows.

  users quickly find the information they need. The platform supports hierarchical
  page organization, tags, and tags for logical content structure.

- **Development Teams** who need technical documentation with code syntax
  highlighting and Git integration
- **Organizations** requiring centralized knowledge management with role-based
  access controls
