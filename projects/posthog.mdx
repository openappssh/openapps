PostHog is a comprehensive product analytics platform that gives you the tools to understand user behavior, test features, and build better products. Unlike traditional analytics tools that only show you what happened, PostHog helps you understand why and provides the tools to act on those insights.

With PostHog, you can:

- Track user behavior with automatic event capture and custom events
- Watch actual user sessions with session recordings
- Test features safely with feature flags and experimentation
- Run A/B tests and multivariate experiments
- Collect user feedback with in-app surveys
- Analyze user journeys and conversion funnels
- Maintain complete data ownership with self-hosting

## Key Features

### Product Analytics

Comprehensive analytics that go beyond basic page views to track user interactions, custom events, and product usage patterns. Understand how users engage with your product and identify opportunities for improvement.

### Session Recordings

Watch real user sessions to see exactly how people interact with your product. Session recordings help you identify usability issues, understand user behavior, and validate product decisions with actual user data.

### Feature Flags

Deploy features safely with granular feature flags that let you control who sees what functionality. Roll out features gradually, perform canary releases, and kill switches for instant rollback if needed.

### A/B Testing and Experimentation

Run sophisticated experiments with multivariate testing, statistical significance monitoring, and automatic result analysis. Test everything from UI changes to entire feature sets with confidence.

### User Surveys and Feedback

Collect targeted user feedback with in-app surveys and NPS scoring. Trigger surveys based on user behavior or feature usage to gather contextual insights when they matter most.

### Funnel Analysis

Understand your conversion paths with detailed funnel analysis that shows where users drop off and what drives them to convert. Optimize your user journey with data-driven insights.

### Cohort Analysis

Track user retention and behavior changes over time with powerful cohort analysis tools. Understand how different user segments behave and how product changes affect retention.

### Path Analysis

Visualize user journeys through your product to understand common navigation patterns and identify optimization opportunities. See how users actually move through your application.

### Custom Dashboards

Build personalized dashboards that focus on the metrics that matter most to your team. Share insights across your organization with customizable views for different stakeholders.

### Real-time Data

Get instant insights with real-time data processing and dashboard updates. Monitor product performance and user behavior as it happens, not hours or days later.

### HogQL Query Language

Use PostHog's powerful SQL-like query language to dive deep into your data. HogQL provides the flexibility to answer complex questions about user behavior and product performance.

### Data Warehouse Integration

Connect PostHog to your existing data infrastructure with native integrations for BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, and other data warehouses. Combine product analytics with business data.

### Privacy-First Architecture

Built with privacy in mind, PostHog provides GDPR compliance tools, data anonymization options, and complete control over data storage and processing when self-hosted.

### Team Collaboration

Share insights, collaborate on experiments, and align teams around product metrics with built-in collaboration tools and shared workspaces.

### API and Integrations

Extensive APIs and pre-built integrations with popular tools like Slack, Zapier, Segment, and more. Embed PostHog into your existing workflows and toolchain.

### Self-Hosting and Cloud Options

Choose between PostHog Cloud for managed hosting or self-host for complete data control. Both options provide the same feature set with different trade-offs for convenience vs. control.

PostHog eliminates the need for multiple product analytics tools by providing everything you need to understand users, test hypotheses, and build better products in a single, integrated platform. Whether you're a startup validating product-market fit or an enterprise optimizing complex user journeys, PostHog gives you the insights and tools to make data-driven product decisions.
