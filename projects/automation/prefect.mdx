Prefect is a powerful workflow orchestration framework that helps data teams transform Python scripts into production-ready data pipelines. It provides the tools and visibility needed to build resilient, automated workflows that can handle complex dependencies, retries, and monitoring requirements.

## Key Features

- **Simple Python-Native Workflows**: Prefect uses decorators to transform regular Python functions into observable workflows. The `@flow` and `@task` decorators make it easy to define and orchestrate complex pipelines while maintaining pure Python syntax.

- **Robust Error Handling**: Built-in support for retries, timeouts, and failure notifications helps ensure workflow reliability. Workflows can automatically recover from transient failures and notify teams when intervention is needed.

- **Flexible Scheduling & Triggers**: Workflows can be scheduled using cron expressions or triggered by events. The platform supports complex scheduling patterns and event-driven execution.

- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: The Prefect UI provides real-time visibility into workflow execution, logs, and metrics. Teams can track workflow health and troubleshoot issues through a modern dashboard interface.

- **Cloud or Self-Hosted**: Choose between Prefect Cloud for a managed experience or self-host the Prefect server for complete control. Both options provide the same core orchestration capabilities.

## Who Should Use Prefect

Prefect is ideal for:

- **Data Engineers** building ETL pipelines and data workflows
- **Data Scientists** automating model training and deployment
- **MLOps Teams** orchestrating machine learning workflows
- **Analytics Engineers** scheduling data transformations
- **DevOps Teams** automating infrastructure tasks

## Getting Started

Prefect can be installed via pip and requires Python 3.9+. The platform provides a local development server for testing and a production server for deployment. Basic workflows can be created with just a few lines of code:

Whether you're building simple data pipelines or complex ML workflows, Prefect provides the orchestration capabilities needed for modern data stack automation while maintaining the simplicity of pure Python.
