# TinyAuth

The easiest way to secure your apps with a login screen. Simple authentication middleware that adds username/password login or OAuth to all of your Docker apps.

## Overview

TinyAuth is a lightweight authentication middleware designed specifically for homelab and self-hosted environments. It provides a simple way to add authentication to any Docker application without modifying the application itself. Built with simplicity in mind, TinyAuth integrates seamlessly with reverse proxies like Traefik, Caddy, and Nginx Proxy Manager to protect your services with minimal configuration.

## Key Features

### Simple Authentication

- **Username/Password Login**: Basic authentication with bcrypt password hashing
- **OAuth Integration**: Support for Google, GitHub, and generic OAuth providers
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: TOTP support for enhanced security
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable timeouts
- **Password Reset**: Built-in password reset functionality with email notifications
- **User Whitelisting**: Control access with user and OAuth whitelists

### Forward Authentication

- **Traefik Integration**: Native support for Traefik forward authentication
- **Nginx Support**: Compatible with Nginx auth_request module
- **Caddy Integration**: Works with Caddy's forward_auth directive
- **Header Injection**: Passes user information to protected applications
- **OIDC Claims Mapping**: Map OIDC claims to HTTP headers
- **Group-Based Access**: Control access based on OAuth groups

### Modern Web Interface

- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful, mobile-friendly login interface
- **Dark Mode**: Automatic dark/light theme switching
- **Customizable**: Modify login screen text and appearance
- **Multi-language**: Support for multiple languages with crowdin integration
- **Progressive Web App**: Can be installed as a PWA on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant interface design

### Enterprise Features

- **OIDC Provider**: Act as an OIDC provider for other applications
- **Auto-Redirect**: Automatically redirect to preferred OAuth provider
- **Regex Support**: Advanced user matching with regular expressions
- **Warning Screens**: Security warnings for redirect URI mismatches
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of authentication events
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go for high performance and low resource usage
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript and modern CSS
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with secure session management
- **Security**: CSRF protection, secure cookies, and rate limiting
- **Deployment**: Single Docker container with minimal dependencies
- **Configuration**: Environment variables or YAML configuration
- **Database**: Built-in user storage with optional external databases
- **Proxy Integration**: Native support for popular reverse proxies

## Use Cases

### Homelab Security

- Protect all self-hosted applications with a single authentication layer
- Add login screens to applications that don't have built-in authentication
- Implement OAuth for services that only support basic authentication
- Create a unified login experience across all homelab services
- Secure internal tools and administrative interfaces

### Development Environments

- Protect staging and development environments from unauthorized access
- Add authentication to demo applications and prototypes
- Secure CI/CD interfaces and development tools
- Protect internal documentation and wikis
- Control access to development databases and admin panels

### Small Business Applications

- Secure employee access to internal tools and systems
- Implement single sign-on for business applications
- Control access to customer data and business intelligence tools
- Protect file sharing and collaboration platforms
- Secure remote access to business applications

### Educational Institutions

- Control student access to educational resources and tools
- Protect administrative systems and student information
- Secure research tools and laboratory management systems
- Implement class-specific access controls
- Protect grading systems and academic records

## Self-Hosting Benefits

### Complete Security Control

- **Authentication Ownership**: Keep all authentication data on your infrastructure
- **Custom Security Policies**: Implement organization-specific security requirements
- **Privacy Protection**: No third-party access to user authentication data
- **Audit Capabilities**: Full visibility into authentication events and user activity
- **Compliance**: Meet specific regulatory and compliance requirements

### Cost Efficiency

- **No Per-User Fees**: Unlimited users without subscription costs
- **Resource Efficient**: Minimal server resources required for operation
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Avoid dependency on commercial authentication services
- **Predictable Costs**: One-time setup instead of ongoing subscription fees
- **Scale Freely**: Add as many protected applications as needed

### Customization & Integration

- **Source Code Access**: Modify and extend functionality as needed
- **Custom Branding**: Implement your organization's visual identity
- **Integration Freedom**: Connect with any internal systems and tools
- **Custom Workflows**: Implement specific authentication workflows
- **API Extensions**: Build custom features and integrations

## Installation & Configuration

### Docker Deployment

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  tinyauth:
    image: ghcr.io/steveiliop56/tinyauth:v3
    container_name: tinyauth
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - SECRET=your-random-32-character-string
      - APP_URL=https://auth.yourdomain.com
      - USERS=admin:$2a$10$hashed_password_here
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.tinyauth.rule=Host(`auth.yourdomain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.tinyauth.forwardauth.address=http://tinyauth:3000/api/auth/traefik"
```

### Traefik Integration

```yaml
# Protect any service with TinyAuth
services:
  whoami:
    image: traefik/whoami
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule=Host(`app.yourdomain.com`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.whoami.middlewares=tinyauth"
```

### OAuth Configuration

```yaml
# Add OAuth providers
environment:
  - OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
  - OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
  - OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_client_id
  - OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_client_secret
